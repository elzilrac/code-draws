What is this project?
This is a collection of code for creating procedurally generated images. The end goal is to produce environment details like trees and rocks, but for now I'm starting with simpler, more abstract shapes.

Dependencies
/lib/require.js
This depends on require.js. Put it a lib folder in the root of the project.

Misc Notes.
This is a collection of personal work. Things in the OLD folder are old code. Scheduled for either deletion or to be organized and dealt with later.
